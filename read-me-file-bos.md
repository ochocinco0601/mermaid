# Business Observability System (BOS) Factory Workspace

This repository supports the design, prototyping, and governance of the Business Observability System (BOS) Factory. It is organized to streamline the definition of business observability templates, prompt-based generation of signal content, and output artifacts such as dashboard specs and traceability views.

## 💬 How to Use with GitHub Copilot Chat

1. **Open the Workspace**
   Launch VS Code and open `bo_system.code-workspace`
   This will scope Copilot Chat to just the relevant folders.

2. **Work with a Template**
   Open a file from `templates/`
   Ask Copilot Chat things like:

   * "Validate this template for missing or vague fields."
   * "Generate sample business and performance signals for a mortgage application step."
   * "Summarize this template into a reference card format."

3. **Run a Prompt**
   Open a `.md` file from `prompts/`
   Copy the content into Copilot Chat or refine it directly to generate structured BOS content.

4. **Save Outputs**
   Generated content should be saved in the `outputs/` folder for traceability and version control.

## 🧠 Purpose of This Repo

This repo acts as a standalone system to:

* Define BOS artifacts in a reusable, version-controlled way
* Leverage GitHub Copilot Chat for interactive template completion and signal generation
* Track output content independently from other observability documentation

---

## 🚧 Roadmap Ideas (Optional)

You can expand this repo to include:

* Signal matrices and mappings
* Business flow visualizations
* Role-based checklists for onboarding new teams into BOS
* Validation scripts or automation for checking template completeness

## 🔐 Repository Scope

This Git repository is intended to operate independently of the parent `Business-Observability` repository. If using both, make sure the parent repo's `.gitignore` includes:

```
/BO_System/
```

This ensures Git doesn’t attempt to version both levels of the repo.
