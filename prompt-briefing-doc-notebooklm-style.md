# Header
**Title:** Ben Sigelman on Observability  
**Date:** 2024-09-01  
**Sources:**  
- “Observability Helps People Plan Changes Faster | Ben Sigelman” (Interview Excerpts)

# Summary
Ben Sigelman reframes observability as “change intelligence”—a tool to accelerate planned deployments and speed incident response—while arguing it must expand beyond engineering into broader business functions.

# Key Themes
- **Change Intelligence:** Observability’s core purpose is to help teams plan and respond to changes faster.  
- **Business-wide Reach:** Observability should serve not only engineering but also support, security, and finance.  
- **Data Platform Imperative:** Vendor-neutral data collection (OpenTelemetry) needs a robust platform for real-time correlation and cost control.

# Key Quotes
- “Observability should be about accelerating change um and responding to change like that's what it should be about.”  
- “With observability… it should be relevant to any aspect of the business.”  
- “The data engineering behind that is extremely difficult… and it has to be done in real time with very little lag.”

# Analysis
1. **Change Intelligence Quote**  
   Sigelman shifts the focus from mere data collection to using telemetry for faster, safer software rollouts.  
2. **Business-wide Reach Quote**  
   He envisions observability driving decisions in non-engineering teams, breaking silos.  
3. **Data Engineering Challenge Quote**  
   Highlights the challenge of unifying diverse telemetry in real time, underscoring the need for strong data pipelines.

# Implications
- Invest in platforms that correlate telemetry across services and business stages.  
- Embed observability practices into cross-functional workflows (e.g., support and finance).
